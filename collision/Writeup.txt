For this challenge we are given a basic encryption/hashing algorithm.
Taking a look at it we see it reads in 20 bytes of information.
It then hashes them into an int.
Working through a debugger whith the breakpoint on the add instruction.
We can see it add groups of 4 with A's, then B's, then C's, and etc.....
This means Taking 5 groups of 4 bytes can add up to the proper value.


./col "`python -c "print('\xc9\xce\xc5\x06\xc9\xce\xc5\x06\xc9\xce\xc5\x06\xc9\xce\xc5\x06\xc8\xce\xc5\x06')"`"
